Wordpress plugin that shows sales grouped by their product category. It is very simple and straightforward. It need a little tweaking because I made it static to work with specific child of a parent category. Some little knowledge on wordpress should be enough. There is also the option to export a specific table(for this also check js/export.js file to tweak it a little)<br>
